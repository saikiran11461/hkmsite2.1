                </h2>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is the Founder-Acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and the greatest ambassador of Vedic knowledge the world has ever seen. He transformed the spiritual landscape of the modern world by single-handedly carrying India's ancient wisdom to every continent.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Born on September 1, 1896, in Calcutta, one day after the auspicious festival of Janmashtami, Abhay Charan De showed early signs of spiritual inclination. His father, Gour Mohan De, raised him as a pure Vaishnava devotee. As a child, Abhay organized his own Ratha Yatra festivals, imitating the famous Jagannath procession.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  In 1922, he had a life-changing encounter with his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami, who recognized his potential and instructed him to spread the message of Lord Chaitanya in the English language. This instruction became the guiding force of his entire life.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  After decades of preparation — studying, writing, and cultivating deep spiritual realization — Srila Prabhupada embarked on an unprecedented mission at the age of 69. With nothing but his faith, a trunk of books, and forty rupees, he boarded the cargo ship Jaladuta and set sail for America. The 35-day voyage nearly claimed his life when he suffered two heart attacks, but he was sustained by the grace of Lord Krishna.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Arriving in New York City in September 1965, he began humbly — chanting under a tree in Tompkins Square Park and giving talks in a tiny storefront on the Lower East Side. Within just eleven years, he built a worldwide confederation of more than 108 temples, rural communities, schools, and restaurants, transforming the lives of thousands.
