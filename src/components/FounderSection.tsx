              His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada is the Acharya of the Hare Krishna Movement. 
              He worked relentlessly to impart knowledge, enlighten minds and establish the 
              Hare Krishna movement globally.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              As a 70-year-old, Srila Prabhupada travelled to New York with the sole purpose 
              of fulfilling his guru's dream of spreading the message of Krishna Consciousness. 
              Starting from a tiny office in New York, he went on to ignite a worldwide phenomenon.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Born on 1st September 1896 in Calcutta, he first met his spiritual master 
              Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami in 1922. In 1944, he launched 
              'Back to Godhead', an English fortnightly magazine now published in forty languages 
              with monthly circulation of over a million copies.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              With very little money, he convinced Sumathy Morarji to give him free passage on 
              the freight ship 'Jaladuta'. After a grueling forty-day sea journey, he reached 
              New York City and began spreading the timeless message of Lord Krishna.
